        <p> My name is Adam. I'm a simple man - I find stuff that's fun, then do whatever I can to make sure I have time
        to do that stuff.</p>

        <p>What kinda fun stuff? Well, a little bit of everything! It can include anything from woodworking to reading, biking to board games,video games to frisbee throwing, making music, solving Rubik's Cubes, playing darts, swimming, axe throwing, or playing with an Etch-A-Sketch. All of these things become more fun when I include       other people who also like to do fun stuff, such as my family. I'll try just about anything if asked.</p>

        <p>My wife and I have two kids and a dog. The 8 year old boy is initially shy, but becomes quite boistrous when he gets comfortable around people, much like me. The 3 year old girl has gumption, which can really kick me in the behind if I'm not prepared - but I otherwise love it. She gets it from her mom 'cuz that certainly didn't come from  me.</p>
